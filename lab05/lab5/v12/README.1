My own built-in shell command is `calculator`.

This command does some simple command such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
The input has the following format, `calculator <firstNum> <operator> <secondNum>`. For example, `calculator 1 + 4`.
I parse the firstNum, Operator and the secondNum. Distinguish it if the operator is `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/` and run the function according to the
operator that the user put.

Finally, it prints out the output to the user.
